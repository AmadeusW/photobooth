fix in cups:
  This release addresses a security issue (CVE-2023-32360) which allows
  unauthorized users to fetch documents over local or remote networks.
  Since this is a configuration fix, it might be that it does not reach you if you
  are updating 'cups-daemon' (rather than doing a fresh installation).
  Please double check your /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file, whether it limits the access
  to CUPS-Get-Document with something like the following
  >  <Limit CUPS-Get-Document>
  >    AuthType Default
  >    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM
  >    Order deny,allow
  >   </Limit>
  (The important line is the 'AuthType Default' in this section)
